## Overview

The Acute Leukemia Methylome Atlas (ALMA) is an open-source project aimed at defining clinical subtypes and risk profiles of acute leukemias through epigenomics. This project provides a comprehensive tool for researchers and clinicians to explore and analyze methylation patterns in acute leukemia samples.
