# Acute Leukemia Methylome Atlas Study Notebooks

## Overview

The Acute Leukemia Methylome Atlas (ALMA) is an open-source project aimed at defining clinical subtypes of acute leukemias through epigenomics. This project provides a comprehensive tool for researchers and clinicians to explore and analyze methylation patterns in acute leukemia samples.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of acute leukemia methylation data
- Clustering and classification of leukemia subtypes based on methylation profiles
- Integration with clinical data for improved diagnostic and prognostic insights
- User-friendly web interface for easy data exploration
