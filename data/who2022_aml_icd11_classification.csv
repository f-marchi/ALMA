"Subtype","Frequency in paediatric AML","Morphology","Immunophenotype","Common co-occurring genetic aberrations","Prognosis"
"AML with RUNX1::RUNXT1 fusion","13–19% of cases","Neutrophilic maturation, Auer rods; often increased basophils and/or mast cells","Positive: CD34, HLA-DR, KIT (CD117), CD99, myeloperoxidase\nUsually positive but can be heterogeneous: CD13, CD33 and CD38, CD19, PAX5, cytoplasmic CD79a, CD56\nNegative: CD7","Mutations in KIT, FLT3, CSF3R, EZH2, ASXL1, ASXL2, CBL, WT1, cohesion genes (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21), NRAS, KRAS","Good"

"APL with PML::RARA fusion","5–10% of cases but wide geographical variation (2–50%)","Exclusively FAB M3; may be hypogranular","Positive: CD33, often KIT (CD117), sometimes CD2\nNegative: CD34 (except hypogranular variant), HLA-DR\nOften high autofluorescence","Mutations in FLT3","Good (but treated differently)"
"AML with KMT2A rearrangement","20% of cases","All FAB types except M3 and M6, most commonly M5","Positive: CD33, CD65, CD4, HLA-DR (in monocytic cases), CD15, NG2; platelet antigens (in megakaryocytic cases)\nNegative/low: CD13, CD34, CD14","Mutations in the tyrosine kinase, PI3K, and RAS pathways; FLT3-TKD, NRAS, KRAS","Depends on fusion partner"
"AML with DEK::NUP214 fusion","1–2% of cases","All FAB types except M3 and M7, most commonly M2 and M4; Auer rods; basophilia in blood or bone marrow; erythroid and granulocytic dysplasia are common","Positive: myeloperoxidase, CD13, CD33, CD38, CD123, HLA-DR; often CD34, KIT (CD117), CD15; sometimes CD64, TdT","FLT3 ITD in two thirds of cases; complex karyotype","Poor"
"AML with MECOM rearrangement","< 1% of cases","Commonly FAB M1, M4, and M7; multilineage dysplasia is common, especially in megakaryopoiesis","Positive: CD34, CD33, CD13, KIT (CD117), HLA-DR, CD7\nNegative: lymphoid markers other than CD7","n/a","Poor"
"AML with ETV6 fusion","1% of all cases","All FAB types, most commonly M0 and M1","For MNX1::ETV6:\nPositive: CD34, HLA-DR, often KIT (CD117), T-cell markers CD7 and CD4","Almost always +19, sometimes +8","Poor, but may be protocol dependent"
"AML with KAT6A::CREBBP fusion","0.5% of cases","FAB M5","Positive: HLA-DR, CD15, myeloperoxidase, CD13, CD33, sometimes CD56, CD14\nNegative: CD34, KIT (CD117)","n/a","OS similar to paediatric AML in general"
"AML with RBM15::MRTFA fusion","0.8% of all cases","Exclusively FAB M7","Positive: > 1 platelet antigen, some CD34 and/or HLA-DR\nNegative: CD45","del(1p), +4, +7, +8, +9, +10, +14, +15, +17, +18, +20, +21(21p), complex hyperdiploid karyotype","Lower CR rate but similar EFS/OS vs other AMKLs"
"AML with CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusion","3% of all cases","All FAB types, most commonly M7","> 50% show the RAM phenotype; overexpression of CD56 and underexpression of HLA-DR and CD38","Mutations in FLT3, GATA1, JAK/STAT pathway","Poor"
"AML with NUP98 rearrangement","5–9% of cases","NUP98::NSD1: often FAB M4 and M5\nNUP98::KDM5A: mostly FAB M7 but also M5 and M6","n/a","For NUP98::NSD1: FLT3 ITD in > 80%, mutation in WT1 in 50%","Poor"
"AML with FUS::ERG fusion","0.3–0.5% of cases","All FAB types except M6; Auer rods","n/a","+8, +10, complex karyotype","Poor"
"AML with NPM1 mutation","6–8% of cases","FAB M1, M2, M4, and M5","Positive: CD33, sometimes KIT (CD117), often CD36, CD64\nNegative: CD34, sometimes HLA-DR\nOften weak CD13","FLT3 ITD, mutations in NRAS, WT1","Good, also when FLT3 ITD is present"
